## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Definitely getting more confident working with styles. The JavaScript was a challenge for me, since I haven't worked with it on my own for quite some time.

I was able to build a spaghetti code at first and manged to get it working quite quickly.

I then decied to refactor it into classes and methods. This was quite a challenge but it refresh my memory about many concepts I had previosly learned.

### Continued development

My code is far from perfect. I did not really spend any time thinking about the architecture and then I just went with what I stareted with.

A lot of side effects and the methods are not really following the SOLID principle.

This is what I need to work on in future projects, bettter planning and putting more thought into this in the beggining.
